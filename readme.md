# Reverse FFI with Mathlib

  This project demonstrates how to call lean code from C/C++. Main lean repository already contains an [example](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/tree/master/src/lake/examples/reverse-ffi) project. Unfortunately, when your lean project depends on std or mathlib the setup gets more complicated and this repository demonstrates how to do that.
